# Chris_Pine_LTP

Chris Pine's classic Ruby book. An excellent and comprehensive overview of the Ruby language.

The book allowed me to come to grips with the Ruby language including topics such as variables, control flow, methods, classes and more.

The book is full of code examples throughout. Chris constantly sets questions throughout the book, ensuring you get to practice with the code taught in each chapter. The solutions (and variations) to the questions are given at the end of the book which is helpful if you get stuck or if you'd like to see a more elegant solution.

A great introduction into Ruby.
